# cipher
Project for CS313E; Substitution and Vigenere Ciphers are used to encode and decode alpha characters.

# deeper explanation
In this program, cipher.txt is read in and lines of alpha characters are encoded and decoding first using substitution and secondly a vigenere cipher.
cipher.txt:
  Line 1: text to be encoded using substitution
  Line 2: text to be decoded using substitution
  Line 3: text to be encoded using vigenere
  Line 4: pass phrase for encode
  Line 5: text to be decoded using vigenere
  Line 6: pass phrase for decode
